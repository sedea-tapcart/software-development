# PR Review Workflow

## No agent gcloud secrets or env-var proposals (binding)

**Forbidden:** updating gcloud secrets; adding environment variables to code; proposing new env vars in plans, options, or follow-ups. **Allowed only** when the developer gives an **explicit same-turn instruction** for a **named** variable. Normative: `.sedea/centers/software-development/rules/60_no-agent-env-secrets.mdc`.

**Lane requirement (no separate warm-up).** This skill has **no** frontmatter **`warmUpRules`** by design. Run it **only** on the active **`coding-session`** lane after that session has loaded ship rules (**`20_efficient-pr-shipping`**, **`.sedea/centers/software-development/missions/plan-and-deliver/plan.mdc`**, **`skills/README.md`**, dev-process). Do **not** start a standalone Mission Control session on **`pr-review`** alone — context will be incomplete.

### Standalone dispatch (stop immediately)

If Mission Control opened a session whose only intent is **`pr-review`** / *triage PR comments* with **no** active **`coding-session`** context (`prUrl`, worktree, worktree name, PR plan, pre-PR history):

1. **Stop** — do not run Steps 1–5 or **`pr-review.mjs`**.
2. Tell the developer **`pr-review`** is **inline-only** on the **`coding-session`** lane.
3. Direct them to open or return to **`coding-session`** (detached phrase, snapshot, or **`plan and deliver`** ship path) with PR identity loaded, then invoke triage from that lane.

**Execution owner:** the active **coding-session agent** runs this skill inline. Do not spawn a separate `pr-review` agent. The coding-session lane has the implementation context, worktree, worktree name, PR plan, prior pre-PR review findings, and developer approvals needed to evaluate and fix PR comments **and failing required CI/check runs** safely. **Clearing the PR** means comment reconciliation **and** required CI green (or explicit developer defer of a specific check) — not comment triage alone.

**Required upstream context:** `prUrl` or `prNumber`, repository identity, worktree path, worktree name, linked PR plan when available, and coding-session ledger state. If this context is missing, return to `coding-session` to recover it before running PR review.

## PR review cycle (normative)

After a PR exists, **`coding-session`** runs this skill **inline** in a loop until merge preconditions hold. The cycle matches the ship chain on the implementation lane:

| Step | Actor | Action |
|------|-------|--------|
| **1** | Ship chain | PR created (`create-pr` or outsider handoff → PR URL recorded) |
| **2** | Reviewers (GitHub) | Humans / external agents review the open PR |
| **3** | **`coding-session`** | Developer picks **`start-pr-review`** → this skill Steps **1–5** |
| **4** | Developer | **Skip-only triage** (0 Must / 0 Should / 0 follow-up) → [Post-pr-review merge approval gate](../coding-session/SKILL.md#post-pr-review-merge-approval-gate) on the **next** turn |
| **5** | **`coding-session`** | **Must/Should fixes** → approved edits → commit/push gate → Step **5 — GitHub only** |
| **6** | Reviewers (GitHub) | Re-review after push (Step **5** may **`request-review`** for `slink-ai` when **`CHANGES_REQUESTED`**) |

**After step 5 (code-fix path):** do **not** open the merge approval gate on the same pass. The invoker (**`coding-session`**) **must** re-open [Post-create-pr handoff gate](../coding-session/SKILL.md#post-create-pr-handoff-gate) on the **next** turn so the developer can wait for step **6**, then pick **`start-pr-review`** again (step **3**). Only after a **fresh** triage pass that is **skip-only** (or merge preconditions in the merge gate all hold) may step **4** offer merge.

**Outsider repos** (`tapcart-push`, `tapcart-merchant-dashboard`): step **4** handoff returns to **`coding-session`** — [Pre-merge authorization gate](../coding-session/SKILL.md#pre-merge-authorization-gate) when **`mergeDelegationAuthorized`** and **`mergeDelegationReady`**, or [Post-create-pr handoff gate](../coding-session/SKILL.md#post-create-pr-handoff-gate) recommending **`start-pr-review-delegate-merge`**. Agent **`gh pr merge`** / **`gh pr review --approve`** only after **`delegate-merge-confirm`** at [Agent-delegated PR approve and merge](../coding-session/SKILL.md#agent-delegated-pr-approve-and-merge). **Outsider** blocks **`gh pr create`** only — not delegation.

**Worktree removal ownership (binding).** **Do not remove worktrees you do not own.** PR review runs in **`WORKTREE_ROOT`** for edits; it does **not** authorize **`git worktree remove`**, **`git worktree prune`**, or **`sedea_remove_worktree_folder`** on any other path. See [`.sedea/centers/sedea/rules/0_hosting-repo.mdc`](.sedea/centers/sedea/rules/0_hosting-repo.mdc) § *Worktree ownership* and rule **20** § *Worktree removal ownership (binding)*. **`git worktree list` is read-only** when ownership is unclear — **stop; do not remove**.


## Agent messaging (MCP)

**MCP spawn/result skill.** Parent→child spawn and child terminal result use MCP tools per **`.sedea/centers/sedea/rules/4_mission.mdc`** § *Agent-to-agent spawn protocol*.

| Action | MCP tool |
|--------|----------|
| Parent spawn (when this skill emits a child lane) | **`mission_control_spawn_agent`** |
| **This** spawned lane terminal (and terminal re-emits) | **`mission_control_send_agent_result`** |

**Binding:**

- Run **`../README.md`** § *MCP spawn preflight* (rows M1–M8) before every MCP spawn; **forbidden** host-resolved identity keys in MCP args (`correlationId`, `dispatchId`, `slotId`, … — see README § *Host-resolved identity*).
- Inline skills on this mission stay **inline-only** — no spawn wire change unless the protocol step explicitly spawns a child lane.

## Global `gh` exception (binding)

When a **global Cursor or developer rule** directs agents to use `gh` for GitHub tasks, that default **yields to this skill** for PR review-cycle operations. While inline **`pr-review`** is active on a **`coding-session`** lane, **`pr-review.mjs` is the only permitted interface** for comment collection, thread/review state, classification, reconciliation, replies, resolves, minimizes, and review re-requests — not generic `gh`, REST, or GraphQL substitutes.

**Permitted `gh` on this skill (narrow allowlist):** Step 0 worktree/URL resolution in the **worktree**; **Step 1b CI status** (`gh pr checks`, `gh run view` / `gh run view --log-failed` for failing required checks — read-only introspection and log fetch only); **`merged-pr-proceed`** merge-state verify (`gh pr view` for **`state` / merge metadata only**); **`approve-merge-pr`** merge inspect (rule **6** § *Merge inspect procedure* — `gh pr view` minimum fields: `state,mergeable,mergeStateStatus,reviewDecision,statusCheckRollup,url` — read-only before any approve or merge mutate); invoker-owned **`gh pr create`** upstream (not this skill). **`check-pr-status`**, manual review submission, rebase, and merge paths on **`coding-session`** may use `gh` for **status/control** only — they do **not** replace Step 1 comment collection or Step 5 reconciliation.

## Structured choice (Mission Control)

Triage and fix loops use **AskQuestion**, **`mission_control_present_structured_choice`** per **`.sedea/centers/sedea/rules/2_ask-question-instructions.mdc`** and **`../README.md`** § *Recap, structured choice, act* on the **`coding-session`** lane — **preferred:** recap (comment summary) + modal in one message. **Act** (code/plan edits) only after developer approval per this skill.

## Checkpoint turn UX (skill-local)

Under Checkpoint trust (`trustLevel: checkpoint`), auto-advance scripted happy-path steps; emit structured choice only at **USER_CHECKPOINT** markers in this section, implicit external-wait surfaces, or exception paths. **No cross-skill inheritance** — gate defaults here apply only to **`pr-review`**; other ship-chain skills document their own markers.

**Real-dispatch test loop (binding):** After merge, run one full inline **`pr-review`** on a **`coding-session`** Checkpoint dispatch through [Disposition gate](#step-4--report-and-disposition-gate) (and [Post-fix commit/push gate](#post-fix-commitpush-gate-binding) when fixes apply) and collect a developer verdict before the parent phase advances **`coding-session`** agent-delegated approve + merge (ship step **6**) — per **Ship-chain skills UX** § *Single-concern strategy*.

Marker syntax: [`.sedea/centers/sedea/docs/user-checkpoint-marker-syntax.md`](.sedea/centers/sedea/docs/user-checkpoint-marker-syntax.md).

### Developer input vs external-wait (Checkpoint)

Under Checkpoint trust, **happy-path** triage steps (Steps **0–3a**, **1b**, approved fix edits, Step **5** after push or skipped-only pick) **auto-advance without a turn-end modal**. **Developer-input** surfaces — disposition scope, commit/push depth, and cycle resume — are **USER_CHECKPOINT** gates on **this lane** (via **`coding-session`** when inline); **must** close with **`mission_control_present_structured_choice`** / **AskQuestion**, not prose idle handoff.

**Forbidden:** *Review the PR and tell me when to continue*, *wait for the user to review*, *tell me when review is done*, or *auto-advancing (no modal)* when dispositions need approval, commit/push is pending, or the developer must pick the next ship action. **Forbidden:** classifying *waiting for the developer to return after GitHub review* as rule **2** external-wait — lane continuation is developer-input via this skill's disposition gate or **`coding-session`** [Post-create-pr handoff gate](../coding-session/SKILL.md#post-create-pr-handoff-gate).

**Implicit external-wait:** none on this inline skill — child **`pre-pr-review`** delivery and Squad Leader **`#external-wait`** resume are owned by **`coding-session`**, not **`pr-review`**.

## Batch mode (`batchShipAuthorized` — binding)

When **`coding-session`** or an **`implementation-session`** invoker sets **`batchShipAuthorized: true`** per [`.sedea/centers/sedea/docs/batch-ship-checkpoint-profile.md`](.sedea/centers/sedea/docs/batch-ship-checkpoint-profile.md):

| Step | Batch behavior |
|------|----------------|
| **3b** / **4** disposition | **Skip gate** — auto **`apply-must-should`** when Must/Should/CI items exist |
| Post-fix commit/push | **Skip gate** — auto commit + push when fixes landed |
| External-wait cycle resume | **Skip** — re-triage until terminal or blocker |

**Blockers** → stop with recap; invoker batch profile governs recovery. **Without **`batchShipAuthorized`**** — gates below apply unchanged.

| Step | Checkpoint behavior | Gate |
|------|---------------------|------|
| **0** — Resolve PR + plan sidecar upsert | Auto-advance when PR identity known | exception: unresolvable PR → stop with recap |
| **1** — Collect comments (`pr-review.mjs`) | Auto-advance — first GitHub-touching action after load | exception: script failure |
| **1b** — CI / check status | Auto-advance on same turn as Step **1** | — |
| **2** — Filter handled comments | Auto-advance | — |
| **3** — Validate and classify | Auto-advance — report prep only; no edits | — |
| **3a** — Propose follow-ups | Auto-advance (handoff only; no plan mutation) | — |
| **3b** / **4** — Report + disposition | **Gate** — mandatory developer pick before any Act — **skip when **`batchShipAuthorized`** | [Disposition gate](#step-4--report-and-disposition-gate) |
| **Approved fix pass** | Auto-advance through edits until commit/push required | exception: blocking tool/git failure |
| **Post-fix commit/push** | **Gate** before `git commit` / `git push` when fixes landed — **skip when **`batchShipAuthorized`** | [Post-fix commit/push gate](#post-fix-commitpush-gate-binding) |
| **5** — GitHub reconciliation | Auto-advance **same turn** as push or skipped-only disposition pick | exception: stale Step **1** payloads → re-fetch first |
| **Cycle resume** — wait for reviewers / new comments | Developer-input on **`coding-session`** — **not** external-wait prose | **`coding-session`** [Post-create-pr handoff gate](../coding-session/SKILL.md#post-create-pr-handoff-gate) |

**Skip disposition modal (binding):** When [Standalone dispatch (stop immediately)](#standalone-dispatch-stop-immediately) applies, **skip** all gates — stop before Steps **1–5**.

## Session orientation table (binding)

Give developers a **consistent state snapshot** during PR review cycles so they can re-orient after reload, tab switch, or parallel work.

**When required:** At every **Mandatory gate** below — render as the **first block** in `displayMarkdown`. **Forbidden:** omitting the table and substituting scattered one-liners.

**Table shape (markdown):**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Plan | `<slug>` @ `<path>` or — |
| Worktree | `<absolute WORKTREE_ROOT>` or — |
| Branch | `<worktreeName>` or — |
| PR | `<url>` (#N) |
| Ship phase | `pr-review` |
| Deploy scope | — |
| CI | `passing` · `failing (N)` · `pending` · `deferred` |
| Review | `prReviewStatus` · GitHub `reviewState` · open Must/Should counts |

**Population rules:** Same as [`.sedea/centers/software-development/missions/plan-and-deliver/skills/coding-session/SKILL.md`](../coding-session/SKILL.md) § *Session orientation table (binding)* — recover missing PR/worktree context from **`coding-session`** before triage.

**Mandatory gates (this skill):** [Disposition gate](#step-4--report-and-disposition-gate); [Post-fix commit/push gate](#post-fix-commitpush-gate-binding) when approved fixes require commit/push; **`coding-session`** [Post-create-pr handoff gate](../coding-session/SKILL.md#post-create-pr-handoff-gate) for cycle resume (developer-input — **not** rule **2** external-wait). Each cycle reopen when new comments land **or** required CI fails again.

## Helper script

Script: `.sedea/centers/sedea/scripts/pr-review.mjs` (reads PAT from `GH_TOKEN`, then hosting-repo **`.sedea/mcp.json`**, then `~/.sedea/mcp.json` for token lookup only — see § *GitHub access*).

### Hosting repo cwd (`pr-review.mjs` and `plan-state.mjs`)

**`pr-review.mjs`** and **`plan-state.mjs`** run from **`HOSTING_ROOT`** (hosting repo whose root contains **`.sedea/`**), not from a worktree’s `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` alone. Canonical contract: [`.sedea/centers/software-development/rules/20_efficient-pr-shipping.mdc`](../../../../rules/20_efficient-pr-shipping.mdc) § *Hosting repo cwd for scripts (canonical)* and [`.sedea/centers/software-development/rules/31_dispatch-scope.mdc`](../../../../rules/31_dispatch-scope.mdc) § *Legacy CLI (`plan-state.mjs`) — hybrid only*.

- **`WORKTREE_ROOT`** — hosting repo worktree where you edit code (`git` / `gh` in Step 0).
- **`HOSTING_ROOT`** — walk up until **`.sedea/centers/sedea/`** or **`.sedea/`** exists; **`cd "$HOSTING_ROOT"`** before **`node …/plan-state.mjs`** or **`.sedea/centers/sedea/scripts/run-sedea-node.sh …/pr-review.mjs`**.

### Node launcher for `pr-review.mjs` (binding)

Invoke **`pr-review.mjs`** through **`.sedea/centers/sedea/scripts/run-sedea-node.sh`** — **never** bare **`node`**. The wrapper sources **`resolve-node.sh`** (Electron-as-Node in Sedea agent shells).

**Forbidden fallbacks when the wrapper exits non-zero:** **`brew install node`** / other package-manager Node installs; **fnm** / **nvm** bootstrap to unblock agent scripts; borrowing Node from another application (Codex.app, foreign Electron, etc.). **Stop and ask** the developer via structured choice — do not improvise a runtime.

The script reads input from (in order): **`PR_REVIEW_INPUT`** (absolute path to a JSON file — keeps payloads **outside** the repo).

### Input file and script: **always two separate steps**

The point is a **reviewable JSON payload** and a **stable allowlisted shell command** (`.sedea/centers/sedea/scripts/run-sedea-node.sh .sedea/centers/sedea/scripts/pr-review.mjs` only) — **never** `printf … && run-sedea-node.sh …` in one line.

1. **First step — write the input file only**
 Create a temp path outside the repo, e.g. `PRR_INPUT=$(mktemp /tmp/cursor-pr-review-input.XXXXXX)` (six trailing `X`). Use the **Write** tool to write the JSON to that **absolute** path (or a **Shell** that **only** writes the file and exits — **no** `&&` to the script).

2. **Second step — run the script only**
 A **separate** **Shell** invocation (from **`HOSTING_ROOT`**, not the worktree root alone):

 `cd "$HOSTING_ROOT" && PR_REVIEW_INPUT="<absolute-path-from-step-1>" .sedea/centers/sedea/scripts/run-sedea-node.sh .sedea/centers/sedea/scripts/pr-review.mjs`

 No `echo`/`printf`/heredoc, no redirection, no `&&` chaining write + script on this line.

**Never** chain writing and executing in one shell line, for example:

`printf '…' > /tmp/foo.json && .sedea/centers/sedea/scripts/run-sedea-node.sh .sedea/centers/sedea/scripts/pr-review.mjs`

That defeats the two-step workflow (re-approval noise, hides the clean script-only command). **Never** use a shell `for` loop that overwrites the input file and calls the script each iteration — put the full sequence in **one** JSON payload (single object or **array** of commands) and run the script **once**.

After success, `rm -f` the temp input file (optional). To invoke end-to-end: **Write** JSON to the temp path, then **Shell** the `cd … && PR_REVIEW_INPUT=… run-sedea-node.sh …/pr-review.mjs` line **once**.

Input format — **one object** (single command) or a **JSON array** of command objects executed in order:

```json
{"command":"threads","owner":"org","repo":"repo","pr":123}
json
[
 {"command":"reply","owner":"org","repo":"repo","pr":123,"comment_id":456,"body":"**Fixed:** …"},
 {"command":"resolve","owner":"org","repo":"repo","pr":123,"thread_id":"PRRT_..."},
 {"command":"minimize","owner":"org","repo":"repo","pr":123,"node_id":"PRR_...","classifier":"RESOLVED"},
 {"command":"summary","owner":"org","repo":"repo","pr":123,"body":"### PR comments addressed …"}
]
```

Supported `command` values: `threads`, `reply`, `resolve`, `minimize`, `pr-for-branch`, `reviews`, `review-comments`, `pull-reviews`, `issue-comments`, `request-review`, `summary`.

### GitHub interface (binding)

When this skill is active, **`pr-review.mjs` is the only permitted GitHub interface** for PR review comment collection, thread/review state used for classification, and reconciliation.

| Operation | Required interface |
|-----------|--------------------|
| Collect comments (Step 1) | **`pr-review.mjs`** array only |
| Re-fetch before reconcile (Step 2 / Step 5) | **`pr-review.mjs`** array only |
| Reply / resolve / minimize / summary (Step 5) | **`pr-review.mjs`** array only |
| PR identity in worktree (Step 0) | **`pr-for-branch`** script command or known **`prUrl`** |
| CI status (Step 1b) | **`gh pr checks`**, **`gh run view`** / **`gh run view --log-failed`** — read-only |
| Merge-state verify (`merged-pr-proceed`) | **`gh pr view`** for merge state only — no comment, thread, or review endpoints |
| Merge inspect (`approve-merge-pr`) | **`gh pr view`** per rule **6** § *Merge inspect procedure* — minimum fields only; no comment, thread, or review endpoints |

**Forbidden when this skill is active:** **`gh api`**, **`gh api graphql`**, **`gh pr view --json reviews,comments`**, or any REST / GraphQL call whose purpose is to collect, classify, reconcile, or verify PR review comments, threads, or reviews.

**First-action invariant:** If invoker context, user context, or an open gate references **`pr-review`**, the first GitHub-touching shell in that turn must be the Step 1 collect array:

```bash
cd "$HOSTING_ROOT" && PR_REVIEW_INPUT="<absolute-path>" .sedea/centers/sedea/scripts/run-sedea-node.sh .sedea/centers/sedea/scripts/pr-review.mjs
```

Run **Step 1b** (`gh pr checks`) immediately after Step 1 on the same turn. Checking PR status during an open **`pr-review`** cycle is **not** exempt from this invariant unless the active pick is **`merged-pr-proceed`** or **`check-pr-status`** on **`coding-session`** (merge metadata only).

**Verification:** After Step 5, re-fetch using the same Step 1 script array. **Forbidden:** using **`gh api graphql`** for thread counts or review-state verification.

Superseded paths (token/config lookup only — **not** for listing threads or posting replies): GitHub MCP server ids such as **`github`** or **`user-github`** in **`.sedea/mcp.json`**. Those tools duplicate **`pr-review.mjs`** and inflate agent context.

## Cyclic review loop (binding)

After inline **`create-pr`** opens a PR, **`coding-session`** runs this skill **in cycles** until **`continuationStatus`** is **`terminal`**:

1. **Open PR** — inline **`create-pr`** records `prUrl` / `prNumber`; [Post-create-pr handoff gate](../coding-session/SKILL.md#post-create-pr-handoff-gate) opens same turn.
2. **Developer picks `start-pr-review`** — load this skill; **Step 1 `pr-review.mjs` collect array is the first GitHub-touching action** for comments (not generic `gh` inspection); **Step 1b** collects CI/check status immediately after Step 1 on the same turn.
3. **Triage** — Steps **1–4** below (comments) plus **Step 1b** CI failures as **Must fix** blockers.
4. **Developer gate** — structured choice for dispositions, CI fix scope, and commit/push depth per rule **6**.
5. **Fix pass** — approved comment and/or CI fixes in **`WORKTREE_ROOT`**; re-run **Step 1b** after push before treating CI as cleared.
6. **Reconcile on GitHub** — Step **5** when required (same turn as push when fixes landed).
7. **Wait for reviewers** — **developer-input**; **`mission_control_present_structured_choice`** via **`coding-session`** [Post-create-pr handoff gate](../coding-session/SKILL.md#post-create-pr-handoff-gate) when the developer returns — **not** rule **2** external-wait. Under Checkpoint, **no** turn-end modal on this skill for idle PR wait — parent gate owns resume picks. **Forbidden:** prose-only *reply with results*, *tell me when review is done*, or *auto-advancing (no modal)* on **`pr-review`** when a developer pick is required.
8. **Loop** — when new comments land **or** CI fails again after push, return to step **2** on the **same lane** until every comment is fixed, skipped with rationale, captured as deferred work, or explicitly deferred by the developer, **and** required CI is green or explicitly deferred.

## When coding-session executes `pr-review`

Optionally followed by a PR URL (e.g. *run pr-review on https://github.com/…/pull/123*).

### Step 0 — Resolve the PR

Determine the PR to review using the **first match**:
1. A URL is provided after `pr-review` → parse `owner`, `repo`, `pull_number` from it.
2. A PR was already reviewed earlier in this chat → reuse that `owner`, `repo`, `pull_number`.
3. Neither above → read the current worktree name ref (`git branch --show-current`), parse `owner`/`repo` from the git remote (`git remote get-url origin`), then look up the open PR via the `pr-for-branch` script command.

Always confirm which PR is being reviewed (print URL and title) before proceeding.

- **Next-step resolution:** Auto-advance to Step **1** on the happy path — no `USER_CHECKPOINT` on this step.

#### Link the PR to its plan sidecar (idempotent)

Before Step 1, attempt to upsert the resolved PR number into the plan sidecar so `plan-reconcile` can later archive the plan when all linked PRs merge. This is the same `upsert-pr` call documented in rule **20** § *Commit and push cadence* step 4 ([`.sedea/centers/software-development/rules/20_efficient-pr-shipping.mdc`](../../../../rules/20_efficient-pr-shipping.mdc)) — running it here as well closes the gap when **`pr-review`** triage ends with all comments skipped (no follow-up commit-and-push pass, so that upsert never fires) or when the PR is otherwise quiet enough that no second push happens. The helper is idempotent, so running it on every **`pr-review`** invocation is harmless.

**`plan-state.mjs`** lives in the center tree: `.sedea/centers/software-development/missions/plan-and-deliver/scripts/plan-state.mjs`. On Mission Control lanes, prefer spawn **`inputs.targetPlanPath`** when known; otherwise **`resolve --cwd "$WORKTREE_ROOT"`** discovers the anchored plan under **`.sedea/operations/…/plans/`** — do **not** construct **`.sedea/operations/.../...`** or **`joint/plans`** paths. See rule **31** § *Dispatch scope (binding)*.

```bash
WORKTREE_ROOT="$(pwd)" # hosting repo worktree (after cd into it)
# HOSTING_ROOT: walk up until .sedea/centers/sedea/ exists — see rule 20 § *Resolve HOSTING_ROOT*
cd "$HOSTING_ROOT"

node .sedea/centers/software-development/missions/plan-and-deliver/scripts/plan-state.mjs \
  resolve --cwd "$WORKTREE_ROOT"
# → exit 0 prints "<slug>\t<planPath>"; exit 2 = no plan; other = error.

# If resolve succeeded, upsert the PR number from Step 0 into the sidecar:
node .sedea/centers/software-development/missions/plan-and-deliver/scripts/plan-state.mjs \
  upsert-pr \
  --slug <slug-from-resolve> \
  --repo "$(basename "$HOSTING_ROOT")" \
  --number <pull_number-from-Step-0>
```

Skip silently when `resolve` exits non-zero (session has no plan) or when `pull_number` is unknown (Step 0 fell through every resolution path). Never block **`pr-review`** on a helper failure — log and continue with Step 1.

**Capture the resolved slug + full `planPath`** (or the lack thereof) for Step 3a. Edit that same `<slug>.plan.md` (sidecar `<slug>.state.yaml` sits beside it). Re-running `resolve` later only to recover the path wastes a shell call when **`targetPlanPath`** is already in inline context.

### tapcart-merchant-dashboard Cypress CI carve-out (binding)

When Step 0 resolves **`repo: tapcart-merchant-dashboard`** (or **`owner/repo`** is **`tapcartinc/tapcart-merchant-dashboard`**):

| Rule | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **Cypress check id** | Check **`name`** or **`workflow`** contains **`cypress`** (case-insensitive) |
| **Step 1b** | Failing Cypress-scoped checks **do not** increment **`ciFailureCount`**, **do not** classify as **Must fix**, and **do not** set **`ciStatus: failing`** when **all** failing required checks are Cypress-scoped |
| **Recap** | List ignored Cypress checks under *Informational — ignored per tapcart-merchant-dashboard Cypress policy*; record in **`outputs.cypressIgnoredFailures`** |
| **Disposition** | When comment triage is clean and **`ciFailureCount === 0`** after exclusion → offer **`approve-merge-pr`** per normal green-CI rules |
| **Approve-merge inspect** | When **`statusCheckRollup`** failures are **Cypress-only** on this repo → treat as non-blocking for agent merge; proceed after developer **`approve-merge-pr`** pick. Non-Cypress failures remain blocking |
| **Terminal** | **`mergeDelegationReady: true`** allowed when **`ciFailureCount === 0`** after Cypress exclusion (even if Cypress checks still fail on GitHub) |

**Forbidden:** treating Cypress failures on other repos as ignored; ignoring non-Cypress required CI on **`tapcart-merchant-dashboard`** PRs.

### Step 1 — Collect comments (`pr-review.mjs` only — no `gh` substitute)

1. Use the resolved `owner`, `repo`, and `pull_number`.
2. Run **`pr-review.mjs` once** with a JSON **array** of commands (same `PR_REVIEW_INPUT` two-step workflow as above), in this order:
 - `{"command":"review-comments",...}` — REST: all inline PR review comments (ids, bodies, paths, lines, authors). Paginated inside the script.
 - `{"command":"pull-reviews",...}` — REST: all submitted pull request reviews (bodies, states, `node_id` for Step 5 minimize, authors).
 - `{"command":"threads",...}` — GraphQL: thread `id`, `isResolved`, per-comment `databaseId`, `isMinimized` / `minimizedReason`, path/line (thread metadata for resolve; **merge** with `review-comments` by matching `databaseId` to REST comment `id`).
 - `{"command":"reviews",...}` — GraphQL: top-level review `id`, `databaseId`, `state`, `isMinimized` / `minimizedReason`, author (bodies come from `pull-reviews` REST only, to keep GraphQL payloads small).
 - `{"command":"issue-comments",...}` — REST: timeline comments on the PR issue (for prior *PR comments addressed* summaries in Step 2).
3. Parse stdout: **one JSON value per array element**, each on its own line, in the same order as the input array (omit trailing commands only if you intentionally used a shorter array).
4. Deduplicate: a comment that appears both in a top-level review body and as an inline comment counts once.

### Step 1b — Collect CI / check status (`gh` allowlist — binding)

Run **on the same turn as Step 1** after comment collection (cwd **`WORKTREE_ROOT`** or any; uses authenticated **`gh`**):

1. **`gh pr checks <pull_number> --json name,state,link,workflow,completedAt`** — list every check on the PR head commit.
2. Classify each check:
   - **`FAILURE`** / **`CANCELLED`** (required for merge) → **failing required CI** — count toward **`ciFailureCount`** and treat as **Must fix** in Step 3 (same blocking bar as comment **Must fix**) — **except** Cypress-scoped checks on **`tapcart-merchant-dashboard`** PRs per § *tapcart-merchant-dashboard Cypress CI carve-out*.
   - **`PENDING`** / **`IN_PROGRESS`** / **`QUEUED`** → note in recap; re-check after fixes or at next loop iteration.
   - **`SUCCESS`** / **`SKIPPED`** / neutral → no action unless the developer asks to investigate.
3. For each **failing** check, fetch logs when useful: **`gh run view <run-id> --log-failed`** (from check `detailsUrl` / workflow run id when parseable) — summarize root cause in the Step 4 report.
4. Record **`ciStatus`**: `passing` when no required failures; `failing` when **`ciFailureCount > 0`**; `pending` when required checks still running and none failed yet; `deferred` only after explicit developer **`defer-ci`** pick (see disposition gate).

**Forbidden:** ignoring failing required CI while declaring **`prReviewStatus: terminal`** or **`mergeDelegationReady: true`**; treating green comment triage alone as PR-clear when checks still fail — **except** Cypress-scoped failures on **`tapcart-merchant-dashboard`** PRs per § *tapcart-merchant-dashboard Cypress CI carve-out*.

### Step 2 — Filter out already-handled comments

**Always skip these before doing any validation or fixing — do not re-address them:**

- **Inline review comments / threads** where the thread's `isResolved` is `true` (from the `threads` command).
- **Inline review comments** where the comment itself has `isMinimized: true` (hidden/collapsed on GitHub).
- **Top-level reviews** where `isMinimized: true` (from the `reviews` command). These have already been collapsed by a prior run or a human.

Plain REST list endpoints do **not** expose `isResolved` or `isMinimized` for threads — cross-reference each inline comment's `id` (same value as GraphQL `databaseId`) against the `threads` GraphQL payload, and each top-level review against `reviews` GraphQL for `isMinimized`.

From the **`issue-comments`** line in the Step 1 script output, scan for prior *PR comments addressed* summaries from this workflow. Skip items already marked fixed or skipped in a previous round even if the thread was never resolved.

### Step 3 — Validate and classify

For each **new** (not filtered in Step 2) comment, verify it against the **current** codebase and assign one of five dispositions:

- **Must fix** — issue is valid, actionable, and blocks the PR before merge.
- **Should fix** — issue is valid and worth addressing in this PR if the developer approves the extra fix pass.
- **Rule-update required** — review feedback requires creating or updating hosting-repo **`.cursor/rules/*.mdc`** files (not product source alone). Classify here when the comment targets rule documentation, governance text, or §5-style hosting-repo rule alignment — even when no code change is needed. Hand off to **`coding-session`** [Post-review repo rules handoff](../coding-session/SKILL.md#post-review-repo-rules-handoff) after developer approval — do **not** silently edit `.mdc` files before the disposition gate.
- **Skipped (no follow-up)** — issue is already fixed in the working tree, factually wrong, or pure noise (e.g. linter chatter the project doesn't enforce). Nothing to track.
- **Skipped → follow-up** — issue is *valid* but *out of scope* for this PR's single concern. Strategy #6 forbids silently expanding the PR; propose a `## Follow-ups` bullet in Step 3a so the item isn't lost.

**CI failures (from Step 1b):** Each **failing required check** is classified as **Must fix** — same blocking bar as comment **Must fix** — **except** Cypress-scoped checks on **`tapcart-merchant-dashboard`** PRs per § *tapcart-merchant-dashboard Cypress CI carve-out*. Include check name, workflow, and log summary in the Step 4 report alongside comment rows. When **`ciFailureCount > 0`** and all comment dispositions are **Skipped** variants, the disposition gate still offers CI fix paths (see Step **4** § *Build disposition options*).

Do **not** apply fixes yet. First report the classification; then open the Step **3b** gate (below) — **except** under Checkpoint auto-advance in Step **4** — do **not** end the turn with prose “wait for approval”.

### Step 3b — Developer approval gate

Run this gate only after Step 3a has prepared proposed follow-ups and Step **4** has printed the classification report.

Before applying any code, plan, or GitHub changes, open the **disposition gate** in Step **4** (`mission_control_present_structured_choice` or **AskQuestion** with the **contextual** option set in Step **4** § *Build disposition options*) — **unless** Checkpoint auto-advance in Step **4** applies. **Do not** duplicate the gate in prose.

**Contextual options (binding):** List **only** disposition actions valid for this PR's Step 3 classification counts — see Step **4** § *Build disposition options*. **Forbidden:** showing **`apply-must`** or **`apply-must-should`** when **`mustCount`** and **`shouldCount`** are both **0** and **`ciFailureCount === 0`**; showing **`apply-rule-updates`** when **`ruleUpdateCount`** is **0**; showing **`follow-ups-only`** when **`followUpCount`** is **0**; showing **`skip-reject`** or **`submit-manual-review`** as the primary path when **`ciFailureCount > 0`** without also offering **`fix-ci-only`** or **`apply-must-should`** (CI fixes). **`more-details`** is always included.

No source edits, plan edits, commits, pushes, GitHub replies, resolves, minimizes, or review re-requests may happen until the developer chooses an approval option shown in the modal **or** Checkpoint auto-advance resolves an implicit pick.

When the approved scope includes **Follow-ups only** or includes any **Skipped → follow-up** comments, append only those approved bullets to the linked PR plan's `## Follow-ups` section before Step 5. If the developer rejects a proposed follow-up, do not mutate the plan or mention it as captured in GitHub reconciliation.

After approved fixes are applied, open [Post-fix commit/push gate](#post-fix-commitpush-gate-binding) before `git commit` or `git push` — **Checkpoint:** auto-advance commit + push when the invoker lane is Checkpoint and the developer did not name defer — do not commit or push silently on non-Checkpoint.

- **Next-step resolution:** Auto-advance through Steps **1–3a** on the happy path — no `USER_CHECKPOINT` until Step **4** disposition gate.

### Step 3a — Propose out-of-scope flags as follow-ups

Per [`development-process.md`](../../../../docs/development-process.md) § *Cadence — Feedback Collection*, items surfaced by **an automated reviewer agent (for example Code Rabbit)** during PR review that aren't worth blocking the PR on land in the PR plan's `## Follow-ups` section as **Code Review Follow-ups** (Strategy #6 forbids the silent scope expansion; the follow-up is the safe escape valve). This step mirrors `pre-pr-review` runner Step 6 — same section, same bullet shape, same routing semantics — so **`plan-reconcile`** can drain both sources at archive time without distinguishing.

**Skip this step entirely** when Step 0's sub-step returned no slug (`resolve` exited non-zero, or no PR plan is linked yet). Acknowledge once: *"No plan linked to this PR; skipping follow-ups capture. Out-of-scope flags surface in the Step 4 report only — copy anything actionable into a new plan or follow-up issue if needed."*

Otherwise, for every comment marked **Skipped → follow-up** in Step 3, prepare a one-sentence bullet for the linked PR plan file **`planPath`** from Step 0 (absolute path from **`resolve`** or inline **`targetPlanPath`**). Do **not** append yet. The Step 3b developer approval gate must approve follow-up capture before any plan mutation. Each proposed bullet:

- Paraphrases the comment's substantive concern in one sentence — do **not** quote the GitHub body verbatim (the comment thread already preserves it).
- Carries an optional `(target: <hint>)` suffix when routing is obvious — `Master Plan`, `current phase plan`, `sibling plan`, `new-plan (standalone)`, `drop`.
- Will live at the bottom of the file if approved. If the PR plan has no `## Follow-ups` section yet, the approved mutation adds one at the bottom (after § 7 Caveats, or after § 6 if § 7 is omitted) using a single `StrReplace` that inserts the header + the new bullets in one shot.

Do **not** include `Must fix`, `Should fix`, or `Skipped (no follow-up)` items here — those don't survive the PR as follow-up planning items (`Must` / `Should` land in the diff after approval; `Skipped (no follow-up)` is noise by definition).

Acknowledge: *"Prepared <K> Code Review Follow-ups for `<slug>.plan.md` § Follow-ups; awaiting developer approval before appending."*

Plan files live under **`.sedea/operations/`** on the primary hosting repo. In the Sedea `app` monorepo, see `.sedea/centers/sedea/rules/0_hosting-repo.mdc`: that tree is often its **own** git repository, gitignored or submodule-pinned from the monorepo. Edits to `*.plan.md` / `*.state.yaml` therefore may **not** appear in the hosting repo worktree's `git status`. Sync plan changes through whatever workflow owns the operations repository (for example a dedicated `operations` commit), not only the `app` PR — rule **20** § *Commit and push cadence* still commits hosting-repo source changes as usual when the developer requests *commit* / *push* in the same message.

### Step 4 — Report and disposition gate

Print **every** comment in its original form (quote the body). For each one, state one of five dispositions:

- **Must fix** — why it blocks and what edit is proposed or applied after approval.
- **Should fix** — why it is useful and what edit is proposed or applied after approval.
- **Rule-update required** — which **`.cursor/rules/*.mdc`** path(s) need create/update and why; reference [Post-review repo rules handoff](../coding-session/SKILL.md#post-review-repo-rules-handoff) as the follow-up path on the open PR.
- **Skipped (no follow-up)** — why it doesn't apply (already fixed, factually wrong, pure noise).
- **Skipped → follow-up** — paraphrase the planning concern + the `(target: …)` hint (if any) proposed in Step 3a. Reference the slug so the user can approve or reject: *"Proposed for `<slug>.plan.md` § Follow-ups."*

When **`ciFailureCount > 0`**, add a **CI failures** subsection after comment rows — one line per failing check: name, workflow, state, link, and log summary from Step 1b.

Do **not** reply to, resolve, or minimize any threads yet.

### Checkpoint — auto-advance disposition (binding)

Under Checkpoint trust on the invoker **`coding-session`** lane, **auto-advance** the disposition pick — **no** **`mission_control_present_structured_choice`** — when the developer did **not** name defer / revise / skip-reject / submit-manual-review in the **same** message:

| Condition | Implicit pick |
|-----------|---------------|
| **`ciFailureCount > 0`** and **`mustCount === 0`** and **`shouldCount === 0`** | **`fix-ci-only`** |
| **`mustCount > 0`** or **`shouldCount > 0`** (with or without CI) | **`apply-must-should`** when Should present, else **`apply-must`** |
| **`skippedOnly`** (no Must/Should/CI/rule-update/follow-up) | **`skip-reject`** → Step **5** same turn |
| **`followUpCount > 0`** only | **`follow-ups-only`** |
| **`ruleUpdateCount > 0`** only | **`apply-rule-updates`** |

One-line recap of counts + implicit pick, then **Act** on the **next** turn (or same turn for skipped-only → Step 5). **Exception — gate required:** ambiguous classification, Rule-update mixed with Must when paths unclear, or developer named a non-default path — emit the modal below.

**`fix-ci-only` same-turn loop (Checkpoint — binding):** After auto-advancing **`fix-ci-only`**, the agent **must** investigate all failing required checks (`gh run view` / logs), apply worktree patches, commit/push, and re-run Step **1b** **in the same assistant turn chain** until:

- required CI is **passing** or **pending** with no failures, or
- a failure is **provably out of scope** for this PR (document one-line rationale + offer **`defer-ci`** modal only then), or
- a hard blocker requires developer input (ambiguous product requirement, missing secret, policy).

**Forbidden:** opening Step **4** disposition modal or **`coding-session`** post-create-pr / merge modals between pushes in a CI-only remediation loop when Checkpoint auto-advance applied. **Forbidden:** ending StreamFinal after the first partial push with "remaining failures deferred to Phase N" without running the loop above.

**Next-step modal (binding):** After the report, when Checkpoint auto-advance does **not** apply, call **`mission_control_present_structured_choice`** (preferred on **`coding-session`** spawned lanes — MCP tool call, report recap in **`displayMarkdown`**) or the **AskQuestion** tool with the **contextual** Step **3b** option set from § *Build disposition options* below. The developer may review on GitHub or inspect local diffs **while the modal stays open**; they continue by **selecting an option**, not free-form chat.

USER_CHECKPOINT — pick how to proceed with PR review dispositions on this lane.

#### Build disposition options (contextual — binding)

After Step 3 classification, compute:

| Variable | Rule |
|----------|------|
| **`mustCount`** | Comments classified **Must fix** |
| **`shouldCount`** | Comments classified **Should fix** |
| **`ruleUpdateCount`** | Comments classified **Rule-update required** |
| **`followUpCount`** | Comments classified **Skipped → follow-up** |
| **`ciFailureCount`** | Failing **required** checks from Step 1b |
| **`skippedOnly`** | **`mustCount === 0`** and **`shouldCount === 0`** and **`ruleUpdateCount === 0`** and **`followUpCount === 0`** and **`ciFailureCount === 0`** and at least one **Skipped (no follow-up)** |

**`displayMarkdown`** (required before modal):

1. Triage counts — one line or table: Must / Should / Rule-update required / Skipped (no follow-up) / Skipped → follow-up; when **`ciFailureCount > 0`**, add CI line: *N failing required check(s)* with names.
2. **Omitted-options explainer** when any standard option is hidden — e.g. *"Apply Must / Apply Must + Should are not shown — 0 Must and 0 Should items on this PR."* or *"Skip / reject not shown — N failing required CI check(s) must be fixed or explicitly deferred."*
3. **Merge paths (when PR open):** cross-ref [`.sedea/centers/sedea/rules/6_git-commit-push-gate.mdc`](.sedea/centers/sedea/rules/6_git-commit-push-gate.mdc) § *PR approve-merge structured choice* and [rule **20**](../../../../rules/20_efficient-pr-shipping.mdc) § *PR approve-merge and merge inspect* — **`approve-merge-pr`** at **option index 1**, **`merged-pr-proceed`** at **option index 2** when both are listed; inspect-before-mutate applies after **`approve-merge-pr`** pick.

**`askQuestion.options`** — include **only** applicable rows. When **`prNumber`** or **`prUrl`** is known and agent merge is in scope, list **`approve-merge-pr`** then **`merged-pr-proceed`** before triage/review paths (rule **6** mergeability-first ordering). Always end with **`more-details`**:

| Option id | Include when | Label (brief) |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|
| `approve-merge-pr` | **`prNumber`** or **`prUrl`** known, **`ciFailureCount === 0`** (open-PR triage; omit when required CI is failing — merge inspect will block; omit only when org policy forbids agent merge) | Approve and Merge PR — **Act** per § *Approve-merge act mapping* below |
| `merged-pr-proceed` | **`prNumber`** or **`prUrl`** known (always during PR ship chain) | PR merged — proceed with cleanup — **Act** per § *Merged-forward act mapping* below |
| `apply-must` | **`mustCount > 0`** | Apply Must fixes only |
| `apply-must-should` | **`mustCount > 0` or `shouldCount > 0`** | Apply Must + Should fixes |
| `fix-ci-only` | **`ciFailureCount > 0`** and **`mustCount === 0`** and **`shouldCount === 0`** | Fix failing CI only — investigate and patch in worktree |
| `apply-rule-updates` | **`ruleUpdateCount > 0`** | Apply rule updates — `.mdc` edits on open PR |
| `follow-ups-only` | **`followUpCount > 0`** | Follow-ups only — no source edits |
| `skip-reject` | Triage non-empty and **`ciFailureCount === 0`** | When **`skippedOnly`**: *Skip / reject — reconcile on GitHub (recommended)*; else *Skip / reject selected comments* |
| `defer-ci` | **`ciFailureCount > 0`** | Defer CI fixes — record failing checks in `remainingTasks`; do not set **`mergeDelegationReady`** |
| `submit-manual-review` | **`skippedOnly`** or (**`followUpCount > 0`** and **`mustCount === 0`** and **`shouldCount === 0`** and **`ciFailureCount === 0`**) | Submit manual review on GitHub — open **`coding-session`** [Manual review submission (developer-input)](../coding-session/SKILL.md#manual-review-submission-developer-input) |
| `more-details` | Always | More details for option _ |

**Open-PR merge paths (binding):** Per rule **6** § *PR approve-merge structured choice* and rule **20** § *PR approve-merge and merge inspect*, when agent merge is in scope on a modal that includes both paths and **`ciFailureCount === 0`**, list **`approve-merge-pr`** (**Approve and Merge PR**) at **option index 1** and **`merged-pr-proceed`** at **option index 2** — **never** reverse. When **`ciFailureCount > 0`**, **omit `approve-merge-pr`** — list **`start-pr-review-delegate-merge`** (label **Fix CI failures in worktree — merge when checks pass**) before **`merged-pr-proceed`**. Triage and review-first paths follow as index **3+** unless counts hide them. **Forbidden:** listing **`merged-pr-proceed`** before **`approve-merge-pr`** when both are shown; omitting **`approve-merge-pr`** when agent merge is in scope **and** CI is green; offering **`approve-merge-pr`** while required CI is failing; label *Merge and Approve* or other orderings that invert approve-before-merge semantics.

**Merged-forward (binding):** Include **`merged-pr-proceed`** on **every** disposition gate, post-fix commit/push gate, and developer-input resume modal while **`prNumber`** or **`prUrl`** is set — **even when** last `gh pr view` showed **`OPEN`**. **Forbidden:** omitting **`merged-pr-proceed`** because merge status was stale; using **`check-pr-status`** alone as the only way to discover developer merge on GitHub.

**Approval-gated agent merge (binding):** When a PR is open and **`ciFailureCount === 0`**, include option **`approve-merge-pr`** (*Approve and Merge PR*) on disposition, post-fix commit/push, and developer-input resume gates unless org policy forbids agent merge (omit with explicit recap note). When **`ciFailureCount > 0`**, **omit `approve-merge-pr`** — recap must state merge inspect will block while required CI is failing. **Act only** when the developer selects that option in the **same** turn: run rule **6** § *Merge inspect procedure* (`gh pr view` minimum fields) **before** any **`gh pr review --approve`** or **`gh pr merge`** — branch per § *Approve-merge act mapping* below; hand off to **`coding-session`** [Merge procedure](../coding-session/SKILL.md#merge-procedure) when inspect passes and preconditions are met. **Forbidden:** default-selecting that option; merging without that pick; inferring consent from silence or from commit/push picks; unconditional approve or merge when inspect shows merge-only is sufficient. When the developer does **not** pick **`approve-merge-pr`**, merge stays on GitHub; this lane verifies via **`merged-pr-proceed`**. See rule **6** § *Approval-gated agent approve+merge* and rule **20** § *PR approve-merge and merge inspect*.

**Act mapping:** selecting an option not shown in the modal is impossible; do not treat hidden options as implicit consent. When the developer picks **`fix-ci-only`** or **`apply-must-should`** with CI failures, investigate failing checks (`gh run view` / logs), patch in **`WORKTREE_ROOT`**, then open the commit/push gate — after push, re-run **Step 1b** before treating CI as cleared. When the developer picks **`defer-ci`**, set **`ciStatus: deferred`**, append each failing check to **`remainingTasks`**, and keep **`mergeDelegationReady: false`**. When the developer picks **`submit-manual-review`**, run **`coding-session`** [Manual review submission (developer-input)](../coding-session/SKILL.md#manual-review-submission-developer-input) — do not run Step **5 — GitHub only** on that turn. When the developer picks **`approve-merge-pr`**, run § *Approve-merge act mapping* below. When the developer picks **`merged-pr-proceed`**, run § *Merged-forward act mapping* below.

#### Approve-merge act mapping (binding)

Run on the **developer's response turn** when they pick **`approve-merge-pr`**:

1. **Inspect** — rule **6** § *Merge inspect procedure* (read-only, before any GitHub mutate):
   ```bash
   gh pr view <n> --json state,mergeable,mergeStateStatus,reviewDecision,statusCheckRollup,url
   ```
2. **Not mergeable** — when **`mergeable`** is not **`MERGEABLE`**, or **`mergeStateStatus`** / **`statusCheckRollup`** indicates blocked CI, conflicts, or pending required checks: **stop**; do **not** run **`gh pr review --approve`** or **`gh pr merge`** — **except** when blockers are **Cypress-only** on a **`tapcart-merchant-dashboard`** PR per § *tapcart-merchant-dashboard Cypress CI carve-out* (proceed to steps 3–4). One-line recap of blockers; re-open the same gate with **`approve-merge-pr`** and **`merged-pr-proceed`** still listed — or offer retry / check CI / defer via structured choice when blockers need a separate pick.
3. **Mergeable — approval not required** — when inspect shows merge may proceed **without** a new approval from this actor (no blocking review requirement, no unresolved **`CHANGES_REQUESTED`**, branch policy allows merge without new **`gh pr review --approve`**): set **`outputs.mergeDelegationAuthorized: true`** on the invoker lane; run **`coding-session`** [Merge procedure](../coding-session/SKILL.md#merge-procedure) **`gh pr merge`** path only — **do not** run **`gh pr review --approve`** first per rule **6** § *Mergeable — approval not required*.
4. **Mergeable — approval required** — when inspect shows approval is required before merge: set **`outputs.mergeDelegationAuthorized: true`**; run **`coding-session`** [Merge procedure](../coding-session/SKILL.md#merge-procedure) — **`gh pr review --approve`** then **`gh pr merge`** in the **same act turn** after inspect passes.
5. **Preconditions not met** — when inline triage is incomplete (**`mergeDelegationReady: false`**, open Must fixes, **`githubReconciliationStatus: pending`**, or **`ciStatus: failing`** without prior **`defer-ci`**): recap blockers; do **not** merge — re-open disposition or **`coding-session`** [Post-create-pr handoff gate](../coding-session/SKILL.md#post-create-pr-handoff-gate) as appropriate.

**Checkpoint auto-advance:** when Checkpoint trust auto-advances past a merge modal on the invoker lane, the **inspect procedure still runs** before any **`gh`** mutate — auto-advance waives the modal, not inspect.

**Act mapping:** selecting an option not shown in the modal is impossible; do not treat hidden options as implicit consent. When the developer picks **`fix-ci-only`** or **`apply-must-should`** with CI failures, investigate failing checks (`gh run view` / logs), patch in **`WORKTREE_ROOT`**, then open the commit/push gate — after push, re-run **Step 1b** before treating CI as cleared. When the developer picks **`defer-ci`**, set **`ciStatus: deferred`**, append each failing check to **`remainingTasks`**, and keep **`mergeDelegationReady: false`**. When the developer picks **`submit-manual-review`**, run **`coding-session`** [Manual review submission (developer-input)](../coding-session/SKILL.md#manual-review-submission-developer-input) — do not run Step **5 — GitHub only** on that turn. When the developer picks **`merged-pr-proceed`**, run § *Merged-forward act mapping* below.
#### Merged-forward act mapping (binding)

Run on the **developer's response turn** when they pick **`merged-pr-proceed`**:

1. **`gh pr view <n> --json state,mergedAt,mergeCommit,url`** — always refresh on pick; never trust stale session state.
2. **If `state: merged`:** Set inline result fields `prState: merged`, `mergeSha`, `mergedAt`, `shipPhase: pr-merged`, `prReviewStatus: terminal`, `continuationStatus: terminal`. On **`coding-session`** invoker lanes, continue with [Post-create-pr handoff gate](../coding-session/SKILL.md#post-create-pr-handoff-gate) **`spawn-production-walk`** **Act** (post-merge cleanup → Production walk when applicable).
3. **If `state: open`:** One line: *PR still open on GitHub — pick again after merge or choose another path.* Re-open the same gate **with `approve-merge-pr` and `merged-pr-proceed` still listed**.

**Example fixtures** (illustrative `askQuestion.options` after counts — merge paths always **`approve-merge-pr`** then **`merged-pr-proceed`** when both listed):

| Scenario | Typical options |
|----------|-----------------|
| Must present | `approve-merge-pr`, `merged-pr-proceed`, `apply-must`, `apply-must-should`, `skip-reject`, `more-details` |
| Rule-update only (0 Must / 0 Should / 0 follow-up) | `approve-merge-pr`, `merged-pr-proceed`, `apply-rule-updates`, `skip-reject`, `submit-manual-review`, `more-details` |
| Skip-only (0 Must / 0 Should / 0 rule-update / 0 follow-up) | `approve-merge-pr`, `merged-pr-proceed`, `skip-reject` (recommended), `submit-manual-review`, `more-details` |
| Follow-up only (0 Must / 0 Should / 0 rule-update) | `approve-merge-pr`, `merged-pr-proceed`, `follow-ups-only`, `submit-manual-review`, `skip-reject`, `more-details` |
| Mixed (Must + follow-up) | `approve-merge-pr`, `merged-pr-proceed`, `apply-must`, `apply-must-should`, `follow-ups-only`, `skip-reject`, `more-details` |
| Mixed (rule-update + code) | `approve-merge-pr`, `merged-pr-proceed`, `apply-must`, `apply-must-should`, `apply-rule-updates`, `skip-reject`, `more-details` |
| CI-only (0 Must / 0 Should / 0 rule-update / 0 follow-up, N failing checks) | `merged-pr-proceed`, `fix-ci-only`, `defer-ci`, `more-details` |
| CI + Must | `approve-merge-pr`, `merged-pr-proceed`, `apply-must`, `apply-must-should`, `fix-ci-only`, `defer-ci`, `more-details` |

**Forbidden:** “Review the PR and tell me when to continue”, “wait for the user to review”, fixed five-option menus when counts make options inert, or ending the turn without structured choice when dispositions need approval **and** Checkpoint auto-advance does not apply.

- **`defaultOptionId: skip-reject`** when **`skippedOnly`** is **true** and **`ciFailureCount === 0`**.
- **Next-step resolution:** Auto-advance through Steps **0–3a** and **1b** on the happy path — no `USER_CHECKPOINT` until this gate.

**Act** (edits, plan append, GitHub reconciliation) runs on the **developer's response turn** after modal selection — or on the **next** turn after Checkpoint auto-advance — not in the same turn as the disposition gate modal.

When the developer picks **`apply-rule-updates`**, run **`coding-session`** [Post-review repo rules handoff](../coding-session/SKILL.md#post-review-repo-rules-handoff) on the **next** turn — apply approved **`.mdc`** edits in **`WORKTREE_ROOT`**, commit/push to the **same open PR**, then re-run Step **5** in the **same turn** as push. When **`apply-rule-updates`** is combined with **`apply-must`** / **`apply-must-should`**, complete code fixes first, then run the rule-update handoff before Step **5**.

### Post-fix commit/push gate (binding)

When the disposition pick authorizes source edits and fixes are ready to land, use structured choice **before** `git commit` or `git push` — even when **`coding-session`** already authorized push at ship cut-point. Under Checkpoint trust, this gate is **developer-input** — not happy-path auto-advance. Include **`approve-merge-pr`** then **`merged-pr-proceed`** when PR is open (rule **6** / rule **20** ordering — see § *Build disposition options*).

Put the session orientation table, disposition summary, and `git status --short` in **`displayMarkdown`**. Cross-ref rule **6** § *Merge inspect procedure* and rule **20** § *PR approve-merge and merge inspect* in recap when merge paths are listed.

USER_CHECKPOINT — authorize commit and push for approved PR review fixes on this lane.

| Option id | Label (brief) | Act |
|-----------|---------------|-----|
| `approve-merge-pr` | Approve and Merge PR | § *Approve-merge act mapping* — rule **6** inspect before mutate |
| `merged-pr-proceed` | PR merged — proceed with cleanup | § *Merged-forward act mapping* |
| `commit-and-push` | Commit and push — run Step 5 same turn | **`git commit`** + **`git push`** per rule **6**; **same turn** run Step **5 — GitHub only**; re-run **Step 1b** before declaring CI cleared |
| `commit-only` | Commit only — defer push | **`git commit`**; open push gate on next turn or defer via **`coding-session`** |
| `revise-dispositions` | Revise dispositions or fixes | Re-open [Disposition gate](#step-4--report-and-disposition-gate) |
| `defer-pr-review` | Defer — stay on pr-review | `continuationStatus: "active"`; no commit/push |
| `more-details` | More details for option _ | Elaborate; re-open this gate |

- **`defaultOptionId: commit-and-push`** when fixes are complete and CI re-check is not pending.
- **Next-step resolution:** Auto-advance from disposition **Act** through fix edits until this gate — no modal between approved edits and commit authorization.

If all comments were **Skipped (no follow-up)** with **no** code edits **and** **`ciFailureCount === 0`**, the Step **4** disposition pick may authorize proceeding directly to Step **5 — GitHub only** (skipped-only path) — **no** post-fix commit/push gate.

### Step 5 — GitHub reconciliation (after commit and push or skipped-only)

**Entry points:**

- **After commit and push (normal path)** — [`.sedea/centers/software-development/rules/20_efficient-pr-shipping.mdc`](../../../../rules/20_efficient-pr-shipping.mdc) § *Commit and push cadence* runs **git commit + push** in steps 1–2 first (same user message). The agent handling that cadence must then run **this skill’s Step 5 — GitHub only** as **step 3** (same agent turn), **before** plan upsert and **create-pr** prompt. Do **not** treat the cadence as finished at push if Step 4 ran in this chat and GitHub is still open.

- **Skipped-only triage** — Step 3 marked every comment **Skipped (no follow-up)** with **no** code edits: run **GitHub only** immediately (no commit/push).

**GitHub only** (two-step `PR_REVIEW_INPUT` + `.sedea/centers/sedea/scripts/run-sedea-node.sh .sedea/centers/sedea/scripts/pr-review.mjs` per § *Input file and script* — never chain write + script):

1. **Reply + resolve** each inline thread using approved dispositions from Step 4 — **Must fix**, **Should fix**, **Skipped (no follow-up)**, or **Skipped → follow-up** (same paraphrase + `(target: …)` as Step 3a) plus short reasoning, then resolve the thread.

2. **Minimize** every top-level review (`PRR_` node) from **every** reviewer (outsider / external agents, humans) with `{"command":"minimize",...,"node_id":"PRR_...","classifier":"RESOLVED"}`. Use GraphQL `reviews` + REST `pull-reviews` from Step 1. One JSON **array** of `minimize` objects; one script invocation.

3. **Re-request review** from the **automated reviewer** when any `pull-reviews` entry from that reviewer has `state` **CHANGES_REQUESTED** — use the reviewer login from Step 1 `pull-reviews` (for example `{"command":"request-review",...,"reviewers":["<automated-reviewer-login>"]}`).

4. **Summary** comment — `{"command":"summary",...}` with body shaped like:

```
### PR comments addressed (commit abc1234)

- [x] Fixed: URL-encode `timezone` param in api.ts
- [x] Fixed: aggregate loading state in LiveFeed
- [ ] Skipped: query keys not app-scoped (app switch reloads page)
- [~] Skipped → follow-up: extract shared retry helper (captured to `<slug>.plan.md` § Follow-ups, target: current phase plan)
```

The `[~]` marker plus the explicit "captured to … § Follow-ups" pointer lets reviewers cross-reference what was deferred without leaving the GitHub comment thread. Use one bullet per comment, mirroring the dispositions assigned in Step 4. Replace `abc1234` with `git rev-parse --short HEAD` after the push in rule **20** § *Commit and push cadence* (or the commit you just pushed).

If Step 1 payloads are **missing or stale** in context (new comments since fetch, fresh chat), re-run **Step 1**’s `pr-review.mjs` array for the same `owner` / `repo` / `pull_number`, then run **GitHub only** above — do **not** start a second full **`pr-review`** triage unless you truly cannot resolve the PR identity.

### Step 5 turn invariant (binding)

When this chat ran **`pr-review`** Steps **1–4** and the developer picked **`apply-must`**, **`apply-must-should`**, **`fix-ci-only`**, or **`fix-now-session`**, then the agent commits/pushes (or takes the skipped-only path with no edits), **Step 5 must run in that same assistant turn** before any **`mission_control_present_structured_choice`** that offers merge, re-triage, post-create-pr forward paths, or “next cycle” options.

**Forbidden:**

- Ending the turn at **`git push`** success without Step 5 when Step 4 ran in-session.
- Offering **`start-pr-review`** / **`rerun-pr-review`** as the primary path when only Step 5 was skipped — use **`reconcile-github-only`** at [Post-create-pr handoff gate](../coding-session/SKILL.md#post-create-pr-handoff-gate) instead.
- Stating ship cadence or **`mergeDelegationReady`** complete while **`CHANGES_REQUESTED`** reviews, unresolved dispositioned threads, or failing required CI remain.

**Skipped-only path:** When Step 3 marked every comment **Skipped (no follow-up)** with **no** code edits, Step 5 runs immediately in the disposition response turn (no commit/push) — still **same turn** as the Step 3b pick.

### Reconciliation completeness checklist (binding)

Set **`outputs.githubReconciliationStatus: complete`** only when **all** pass (re-fetch Step 1 payloads when stale):

| # | Check |
|---|--------|
| 1 | **Inline threads:** every dispositioned comment has an agent **reply** |
| 2 | **Resolve:** every dispositioned thread has **`isResolved: true`** (resolve any still open) |
| 3 | **Top-level reviews:** every non-minimized **`PRR_`** from bot/human reviewers is **minimized** with `classifier: RESOLVED` when dispositions are addressed or skipped with rationale |
| 4 | **Summary:** **`summary`** command posted with commit short SHA and bullets mirroring Step 4 dispositions |

Until all four pass, keep **`githubReconciliationStatus: pending`** and **`mergeDelegationReady: false`**.

## §8 host sync (via coding-session)

Runs **inline** on the **`coding-session`** lane. When triage reaches a stable milestone, the **`coding-session`** agent **must** re-emit **`mission_control_send_agent_result`** with §8 **`outputs`** so Mission Control host sync updates the Squad Leader ledger (**`../../plan.mdc`** §8).

| Milestone | `shipPhase` | Required `outputs` |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| PR comments triaged / reconciliation done | `pr-review` | `targetPlanPath`, `shipPhase`, `rowStatus`, `prReviewStatus`, `githubReconciliationStatus`, `mergeDelegationReady`, `ciStatus`, `ciFailureCount`, `remainingTasks` |
| Agent merged PR (delegated path) | `pr-merged` | `targetPlanPath`, `shipPhase`, `rowStatus`, `prUrl`, `prNumber`, `mergeSha`, `mergedAt` |

**Forbidden:** nudging manual **Ship recap** on the leader dispatch.

## Inline result for coding-session

**Inline-only** — no **`## Completion (spawned)`**, no **MCP result**, no **`mission_control_send_agent_result`** on this lane (see **`.sedea/centers/sedea/rules/4_mission.mdc`** § *Inline completion* and **[`../README.md`](../README.md)** § *Inline-only*).

Return results through the active **`coding-session`** lane, not as a child-agent result. **`coding-session`** must include these fields in its spawned handoff or inline completion:

- `outputs.prReviewStatus`
- `outputs.prReviewComments`
- `outputs.prReviewDispositions`
- `outputs.prReviewBlockers`
- `outputs.prReviewFollowUps`
- `outputs.githubReconciliationStatus`
- `outputs.mergeDelegationReady`
- `outputs.ciStatus` (`passing` · `failing` · `pending` · `deferred`)
- `outputs.ciFailureCount`
- `outputs.cypressIgnoredFailures` (array of `{ name, state, link, workflow }` — Cypress-scoped checks ignored on **`tapcart-merchant-dashboard`** PRs per § *tapcart-merchant-dashboard Cypress CI carve-out*)
- `outputs.ciFailures` (array of `{ name, state, link, workflow }` from Step 1b)
- `outputs.prState` / `outputs.mergeSha` / `outputs.mergedAt` when **`merged-pr-proceed`** confirms merge
- `outputs.shipPhase` (`pr-review` or `pr-merged`)
- `outputs.remainingTasks`
- `outputs.continuationStatus`

Set **`outputs.mergeDelegationReady: true`** when **all** apply:

1. Every fetched review comment has an approved disposition (fixed, skipped with rationale, or captured follow-up).
2. **`outputs.githubReconciliationStatus: complete`** — Step 5 checklist passed (§ *Reconciliation completeness checklist*), or the skipped-only path completed with no pending Must fixes (skipped-only triage with no code edits also sets **`complete`** — no separate **`skipped`** value on the merge path).
3. No open **Must fix** blockers remain on this PR.
4. **`outputs.ciStatus`** is **`passing`** or **`deferred`** with explicit developer **`defer-ci`** pick — **not** **`failing`** or **`pending`** on required checks.
5. `outputs.prReviewStatus` is **`terminal`** for this triage pass.

Otherwise set **`mergeDelegationReady: false`** — **`coding-session`** must not open [Pre-merge authorization gate](../coding-session/SKILL.md#pre-merge-authorization-gate) or run [Merge procedure](../coding-session/SKILL.md#merge-procedure) until a later pass clears blockers.

**`githubReconciliationStatus` values:** `complete` (checklist passed or skipped-only path with no GitHub actions required), `pending` (Step 5 required or incomplete). Do **not** use a separate **`skipped`** value when **`mergeDelegationReady`** must be true — map skipped-only to **`complete`**.

Keep `continuationStatus: "active"` until every PR review comment is fixed, skipped with rationale, converted to follow-up, or explicitly deferred by the developer, **required CI is passing or explicitly deferred**, and GitHub reconciliation has run when required.

Set **`continuationStatus: terminal`** only when comment triage is complete, **`githubReconciliationStatus: complete`** when required, and **`ciStatus`** is **`passing`** or developer-deferred — not while required checks are still failing without **`defer-ci`**.

This skill is **inline-only** on the **`plan and deliver`** mission — no **`mission_control_spawn_agent`**, no **`mission_control_send_agent_result`** on this lane. See **[`../README.md`](../README.md)** § Inline-only.
